Based on an earlier study (Kubai, D.F. 1982. J. Cell Biol. 93:655-669), I suggested that the meiosis I spindle does not play a direct role in the nonrandom sorting of chromosomes but that, instead, haploid sets are already separated in prophase nuclei well before the onset of spindle formation. Here I report more direct evidence that this hypothesis is true; this evidence was gained from ultrastructural reconstruction analyses of the arrangement of chromosomes in germ line nuclei (prophase nuclei in spermatogonia and spermatocytes) of males heterozygous for an X- autosome chromosome translocation. Because of this translocation, the maternal and paternal chromosome sets are distinguishable, so it is possible to demonstrate that (a) the two haploid chromosome sets occupy distinct maternal and paternal nuclear compartments and that (b) nuclei are oriented so that the two haploid chromosome sets have consistent relationships to a well-defined cellular axis. The consequences of such nonrandom aspects of nuclear structure for chromosome behavior on premeiotic and meiotic spindles are discussed.', 'pmid': '3693389', 'title': 'Nonrandom chromosome arrangements in germ line nuclei of Sciara coprophila males: the basis for nonrandom chromosome segregation on the meiosis I spindle', 'authors': '[]'}}\n",

The appearance of the intact basement membrane is that of a thin sheet in which there are regions of branching strands. Salt extraction further exposes these strands to reveal an extensive irregular polygonal network that can be specifically decorated with gold-conjugated anti-type IV collagen antibody. At high magnification one sees that the network, which contains integral (9-11 nm net diameter) globular domains, is formed in great part by lateral association of monomolecular filaments to form branching strands of variable but narrow diameters. Branch points are variably spaced apart by an average of 45 nm with 4.4 globular domains per micron of strand length. Monomolecular filaments (1.7-nm net diameter) often appear to twist around each other along the strand axis; we propose that super helix formation is an inherent characteristic of lateral assembly. A previous study (Yurchenco, P. D., and H. Furthmayr. 1984. Biochemistry. 23:1839) presented evidence that purified murine type IV collagen dimers polymerize to form polygonal arrays of laterally as well as end-domain-associated molecules. The architecture of this polymer is similar to the network seen in the amnion, with lateral binding a major contributor to each. Thus, to a first approximation, isolated type IV collagen can reconstitute in vitro the polymeric molecular architecture it assumes in vivo.', 'pmid': '3693393', 'title': 'Basement membrane structure in situ: evidence for lateral associations in the type IV collagen network', 'authors': '[]'}}\n",

J., and F. R. Maxfield. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2713-2721), we have shown that there is rapid acidification of endosomal compartments to pH 6.3 by 3 min in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In contrast, early acidification of endosomes is markedly reduced in the CHO mutants, DTF 1-5-4 and DTF 1-5- 1. Since these CHO mutants are pleiotropically defective in endocytosis (Robbins, A. R., S. S. Peng, and J. L. Marshall. 1983. J. Cell Biol. 96:1064-1071; Robbins, A. R., C. Oliver, J. L. Bateman, S. S. Krag, C. J. Galloway, and I. Mellman. 1984. J. Cell Biol. 99:1296-1308), our results are consistent with a requirement for proper acidification of early endocytic compartments in many pH-regulated endocytic processes. In this paper, by measuring the pH of morphologically distinct endosomes using fluorescence microscopy and digital image analysis, we have determined in which of the endocytic compartments the defective acidification occurs. We found that the acidification of both the para- Golgi recycling endosomes and lysosomes was normal in the CHO mutants DTG 1-5-4 and DTF 1-5-1. The mean pH of large endosomes containing either fluorescein-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin or fluorescein- isothiocyanate dextran was only slightly less acidic in the mutant cells than in wild-type cells. However, when we examined the pH of individual large (150-250 nm) endosomes, we found that there was an increased number of endosomes with a pH greater than 6.5 in the CHO mutants when compared with wild-type cells. Heterogeneity in the acidification of large endosomes was also seen in DTF 1-5-1 by a combined null point pH method and digital image analysis technique. In addition, both CHO mutants showed a marked decrease in the acidification of the earliest endosomal compartment, a diffusely fluorescent compartment comprised of small vesicles and tubules. We suggest that the defect in endosome acidification is most pronounced in the early, small vesicular, and tubular endosomes and that this defect partially carries over to the large endosomes that are involved in the sorting and processing of ligands. The proper step-wise acidification of the different endosomes along the endocytic pathway may have an important role in the regulation of endocytic processes.', 'pmid': '2447098', 'title': 'Acidification of morphologically distinct endosomes in mutant and wild- type Chinese hamster ovary cells', 'authors': '[]'}}\n",

For detection of TGF-beta in 11-18-d-old embryos, we have used a polyclonal antibody specific for TGF-beta type 1 and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Staining of TGF-beta is closely associated with mesenchyme per se or with tissues derived from mesenchyme, such as connective tissue, cartilage, and bone. TGF-beta is conspicuous in tissues derived from neural crest mesenchyme, such as the palate, larynx, facial mesenchyme, nasal sinuses, meninges, and teeth. Staining of all of these tissues is greatest during periods of morphogenesis. In many instances, intense staining is seen in mesenchyme when critical interactions with adjacent epithelium occur, as in the development of hair follicles, teeth, and the submandibular gland. Marked staining is also seen when remodeling of mesenchyme or mesoderm occurs, as during formation of digits from limb buds, formation of the palate, and formation of the heart valves. The presence of TGF-beta is often coupled with pronounced angiogenic activity. The histochemical results are discussed in terms of the known biochemical actions of TGF-beta, especially its ability to control both synthesis and degradation of both structural and adhesion molecules of the extracellular matrix.', 'pmid': '3320058', 'title': 'Role of transforming growth factor-beta in the development of the mouse embryo', 'authors': '[]'}}\n",

Spreading is associated with extensive rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton which resemble those occurring during phagocytosis. We have previously shown that spreading in human neutrophils is preceded by an increase in cytosolic-free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) (Kruskal, B. A., S. Shak, and F. R. Maxfield. 1986. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 83:2919-2923). To assess the generality of this signal, we measured [Ca2+]i in single thioglycollate- elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages as they spread on an immune complex-coated surface, using fura-2 microspectrofluorometry. A [Ca2+]i increase always precedes spreading. This increase can involve several (up to 8) [Ca2+]i spikes, with an average peak value of 387 +/- 227 nM (mean +/- SD, n = 92 peaks in 24 cells), before spreading is detected. Neither spreading nor the magnitude of these spikes is significantly altered by removal of extracellular calcium. Many of the spreading macrophages exhibit periodic [Ca2+]i increases before and during spreading. The proportion which does so varies among experiments from 0 to 90%, but it is frequently greater than 40%. The largest number of cells (approximately 25%) exhibited only a single peak. In 13 cells that showed more than 10 peaks, the median period was 29 s (range 19-69 s). The average peak [Ca2+]i was 385 +/- 266 nM (mean +/- SD, n = 208 peaks in 14 cells). The calcium producing these increases is derived from intracellular pools. The oscillations occur with spreading on either opsonized or nonopsonized surfaces. The function of these oscillations is not clear, but the large number of cells which exhibit them suggest that they may be important to macrophage function.', 'pmid': '3693396', 'title': 'Cytosolic free calcium increases before and oscillates during frustrated phagocytosis in macrophages', 'authors': '[]'}}\n"

The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of three routinely used methods to estimate limb volumes. Methods and Results: Inverse water displacement, girth measurements, and Perometer measurements were executed. Although standard techniques were used, extra precautions were taken to maximize accuracy within and between observers. Water displacement, and girth and Perometer measurements resulted in standard deviations of 0.7%–0.8%, 0.5%, and 0.4%–1.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Measuring limb volumes using routine methods is not easy. Even under optimal conditions, the measurements are quite dependent on the observer. For practical situations, an easy, objective, and reliable method is lacking.', 'pmid': '33751914', 'title': 'Estimates for Assessment of Lymphedema: Reliability and Validity of Extremity Measurements', 'authors': \"['Houwen Frans', 'Stemkens Johannes', 'de Schipper Peter J.', 'van der Wouw Pim', 'Heitink Martijn', 'van Langen Herman']\", 'doi': '10.1089/lrb.2019.0082'}, Similarity: 0.8847\n",

Four different vegetal-dried fibers (hemp, flax, miscanthus, and bamboo) with dosages of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 2, and 4 kg/m 3 were used. Laboratory investigations were slump test, bulk density, air occluded, shrinkage, and mechanical strength.

However, most previous approaches rely solely on either global or local feature-based methods, leading to the loss of relevant expression features. To address these issues, a feature fusion residual attention network (FFRA-Net) is proposed. FFRA-Net consists of a multi-scale module, a local attention module, and a feature fusion module. The multi-scale module divides the intermediate feature map into several sub-feature maps in an equal manner along the channel dimension. Then, a convolution operation is applied to each of these feature maps to obtain diverse global features. The local attention module divides the intermediate feature map into several sub-feature maps along the spatial dimension. Subsequently, a convolution operation is applied to each of these feature maps, resulting in the extraction of local key features through the attention mechanism. The feature fusion module plays a crucial role in integrating global and local expression features while also establishing residual links between inputs and outputs to compensate for the loss of fine-grained features. Last, two occlusion expression datasets (FM_RAF-DB and SG_RAF-DB) were constructed based on the RAF-DB dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FFRA-Net achieves excellent results on four datasets: FM_RAF-DB, SG_RAF-DB, RAF-DB, and FERPLUS, with accuracies of 77.87%, 79.50%, 88.66%, and 88.97%, respectively. Thus, the approach presented in this paper demonstrates strong applicability in the context of occluded facial expression recognition (FER).', 'pmid': '37663762', 'title': 'Occlusion facial expression recognition based on feature fusion residual attention network', 'authors': '[]', 'doi': '10.3389/fnbot.2023.1250706'}, Similarity: 0.8819\n"
